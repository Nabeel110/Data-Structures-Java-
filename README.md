It conains my solutions to recursive problems.
1. The first recursive solution is about summation of numbers upto N.
2. The second recursive solution is about binary Search implemantatiuon using Recursion.
3. The thitrd is recursive soluion is about computing fibonacci sequence using memoziation and recursion.
4. The fourth recursive solution is on famous N Queen problem using recursion.
